# Processing Instructions

You will be processing the descriptions of variables in a survey dataset. Each
description will include the name of the variable and the description provided
by the dataset's creators. However, some of the descriptions are incomplete.
Sometimes an important part of the description of one variable is included in a
previoud variable. For instance, consider these variable descriptions:

    endsmeet: Thinking of your household's total income, including all the
    sources of income of all the members who contribute to it, how difficult or
    easy is it currently for your household to make ends meet?

    opwlth: (For each of these, please tell me how important you think it is
    for getting ahead in life ...) How important is coming from a wealthy
    family?

    oppared : (For each of these, please tell me how important you think it is
    for getting ahead in life ...) How important is having well-educated
    parents?

    opeduc: (For each of these, please tell me how important you think it is
    for getting ahead in life ...) How important is having a good education
    yourself?

The phrase in parentheses in opwlth, oppared and opeduc refers to the first
part of the description of endsmeet, so the full descriptions for those
variables should be:

    opwlth: Thinking of your household's total income, including all the
    sources of income of all the members who contribute to it, how important do
    you think it is for getting ahead in life to come from a wealthy family?

    oppared: Thinking of your household's total income, including all the
    sources of income of all the members who contribute to it, how important do
    you think it is for getting ahead in life to have well-educated parents?

    opeduc: Thinking of your household's total income, including all the
    sources of income of all the members who contribute to it, how important do
    you think it is for getting ahead in life to have a good education yourself?

Other descriptions do not depend on prior descriptions, byt should be
re-written to be easier to read. You should also re-write descriptions so that
they:

    * Do not have parenthetical expressions. For instance, "(If you had other
      partners, does this describe any of them?...) Close personal friend"
      should be re-written as "If you had other partners, does this describe
      any of them? A Close personal friend"
      
    * Convert references to "R's" to "Respondent's"
    
    * Remove instructions to the interviewer. For instance, in "(ASK EVERYONE
      WITH ANY RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE NAMED IN RELIG) Would you call yourself a
      strong (PREFERENCE NAMED IN RELIG) or a not very strong (PREFERENCE NAMED
      IN RELIG)?" The parentetical expressions are instructions for the
      interviewer and should be removed.

    * Convert uppercase and mixed case descriptions into nomal stentence case.

    * Make other gramatical improvements to make the description easier to read
    without losing the meaning


# Formatting Instructions.

You will recieve the variables descriptions as a a list of multiple
descriptions, one per line. Each line will start with a variable name, then a
":", then the description

Return your re-writes in JSONL format, with each line being a JSON dictionary
having these keys:
  variable: the name of the variable
  desc: the description of the variable.

For example, here is valid output for an input with two variables.

    {{"variable": "example_variable","desc": "Description of the example variable." }}
    {{"variable": "example_variable2", "desc": "Description of the second example variable."}}
